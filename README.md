Hello there, my name is Ayush Kumar, and I am a student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. My interests are in:
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (neural networks, computer vision, NLP)
- 🦾 Humanoid Robotics
- 🛰️ Space
- 🔬 Physics/Chemistry

I plan on joining the intersection between AI and robotics and build robots/systems that can make cognitive decisions on its own when a human cannot be involved (e.g. future robots on Mars will have to be independent of human decisionmaking as the time delay in sending instructions is too big).
